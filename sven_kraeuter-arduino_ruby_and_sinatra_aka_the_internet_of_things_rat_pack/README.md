# Arduino, Ruby &amp; Sinatra - The Internet Of Things's Rat Pack

My talk description... draft mode. Let's see how to put it short. Guess these fellows should be included:

[Occupy Ping Ping](https://github.com/makersandco/Occupy-Ping-Pong)

[Empathic Servo](https://vimeo.com/27113323)

Now wrap the mayhem in words!

## Sven Kräuter

Sven Kräuter is making things happen. Earning his living by bringing web apps to life in an agile manner he is also a strong advocat of the future things to come. He loves tinkering with hardware components and since he's too lazy to leave his tech stack, most of the time he lets hacked objects talk with each other with the language he loves the most: Ruby.

Besides developing online products with his customers, he is one quarter of [Makers &amp; Co.](http://makersand.co) where a bunch of IoT afficionados are Creating, Sharing & Connecting people via Hardware hacks.
